It is an Android application based on Online Food Ordering System.
It allows users to order food from the restaurants available on the app.
Users can also mark their favourite restaurants on the application ,so whenever the next time they login they can directly order food from their favorite restaurants.
For ordering food users can select their food to be ordered and can proceed to cart.
After proceeding to cart users can further make payments for their orders to be placed.
For making payments users are requested to have :
    1.Google pay application pre installed on their android phones.
    2.Sim on their android phone must be the same through which they linked their Google pay account with their bank account. 
Users can see their previous orders in order history.

The app is built using kotlin,XML and Java through android studio and uses volley to send get and post request from the Internshala server through rest api calls.
The app also uses the room Persistence library to send data to the SQLite database.
Favourite restaurants are saved inside sqlite relational database management system.
Order history of the user is fetched from the internshala's server using JSON requests.
